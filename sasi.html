COLLECTION FRAMEWORK:
                     The limitation of array is size, that is fixed size, we can't increase the size of an array.
                     With the collection programmer no need to handle the data he can use the data instead.

Variable Size collection: Arraylist, Linkedlist
Distinct collection: Set
Sorted collection: SortedSet
Insert
Delete
Search(Binary search, Linear search)
Hashing(Key, value) pair.

Collection: It is a group of elements
List: It is ordered list of elements. duplicates are also allowed
Set: It is unordered list of elements. duplicates are not allowed.
Treeset: It is used for faster searching
Queue: First In First Out mechanism is used
Deque extends Queue:  We can remove element from either end of an array.

Collection Interface:
                     removeAll(Collection<e> c): It will remove all elements that are present argument collection
                     retainAll(Collection<e> c): It will retain all elements that are present argument collection rest all elements are removed
                     from that datastructure
add(E e)
addAll(Collection<e> c): It will add all elements in the argument list aray to main data structure.
remove(E e)
reomveAll(Collection<e> c):
retainAll(Collection<e> c):
clear(): It will empty an array
isEmpty():
contains(Object o)
containsAll(Collection<e> c):
equals(E e)
size()
iterator(): It is a interface, that means it is having its own methods.
toArray(): convert collection datastructure to array
               
          Interface List extends Collection
                       add(int index, E e)
                       ListItertor(): It allows bidirectional
                       
                       
    Linked List: Here it is easy insert and delete an element in a list in between
                 This linked grow as many nodes as you want adding to size of the linkedlist easily.
                       If you want size more flexible and more variable then go for linkedlist rather than arrayList
                  
                 disadvantages:
                       A part from element size it also want memory for nodes.
