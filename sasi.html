COLLECTION FRAMEWORK:
                     The limitation of array is size, that is fixed size, we can't increase the size of an array.
                     With the collection programmer no need to handle the data he can use the data instead.

Variable Size collection: Arraylist, Linkedlist
Distinct collection: Set
Sorted collection: SortedSet
Insert
Delete
Search(Binary search, Linear search)
Hashing(Key, value) pair.

Collection: It is a group of elements
List: It is ordered list of elements. duplicates are also allowed
Set: It is unordered list of elements. duplicates are not allowed.
Treeset: It is used for faster searching
Queue: First In First Out mechanism is used
Deque extends Queue:  We can remove element from either end of an array.
