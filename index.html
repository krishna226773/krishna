METHOD OVERLOADING:
                    Method overloading occurs when class has mutliple methods, with the same name, but the methods are declared with different parameters.
                    SO you can execute the methods with the same name, but call it with different arguments.
                    JAVA can resolve which method it needs to execute, based on the arguments being passed, when the method is invoked.

SIGNATURE:
          It consists of the name of the method and the uniqness of the declaration of the parameters.
          Parameter name is not part of the signature.
          The type, name, and number of parameter in conjunction with the name of the method, make a method signature unique.


LOCAL VARIABLE:
              It is a local, because this variable is available to use by the code block in which it was declared.

SCOOP describes the accessibility of a varaible.

BLOCK:
      If the statements are described inside the curly braces is called block

If we define method or field with static keyword then that variable or method is been allocated special memory location and only in one place.

If we define variable or method as instance then memory will not be allocated until object is created.
