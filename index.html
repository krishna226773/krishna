SUPER:
       It is used to call methods in child class from parent class that are overridden.

       And also it is used to call parent class constructors.
      
      If the parent class has no constructor then child constructor will throw an error.
THIS:
      It is used to refere to the instance variables
      this keyword is not allowes in any static methods.
      this keyword is used to call another constructor within the constructor.
      this("krishna" "25");

CONSTRUCTOR:
           We can as many as constructors as we want but should vary parameter types.
 
           If we define constructors ourselves JAVA will not provide default constructors. Java provides default constructors only when there are no constructors defined.
 
           We can also restrict defining constructor by doing private infront of constructor. We can still use static fields.
