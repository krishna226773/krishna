Object class is the parent class for all the classes in JAVA.
PRIMITIVES are not objects in JAVA.
WRAPPER classes available for primitive data types which are not objects.
Wrapper around a primitive variable so that primitive become object, that means variable for wrapper class creates a box like structure and placed primitve in that box, the varible 
is taken refernce to that box.

Every wrapper class has a method to convert another type of variable.

int i = 10;
Integer a = i //auto boxing.
Integer b = Integer.valueOf(i); //boxing
int c = b // auto unboxing
int d = b.intValue() // unboxing.

primtives is convert to wrapper is called auto-boxing.
wrapper class is convert to primitive data type is called auto-unboxning.
